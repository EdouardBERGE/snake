Snake is a mini game programmed in two nights in pure assembly language

The game may handle from 1 to 4 player simultaneously

You earn points by going through the blue holes left by snake traces

Player 1 uses LEFT-CURSOR and RIGHT-CURSOS
Player 2 uses the X and C keys
Player 3 uses the H and J keys
Player 4 uses the I and O keys

Keys where choosen to avoid keyboard clash on the real machine, that's why there is no joystick support

Enjoy this for what it is => A mini game!
